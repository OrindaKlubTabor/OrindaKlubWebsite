Any host brothers or sisters?</h3>\n        <p>\n          I was staying with the Marks. My host-dad's name was David, Beth was\n          my host-mom and I had two host-siblings. McClain, the younger one, was\n          my age and we went to Miramonte together. Living with him was just one\n          big adventure and I would say I experienced everything possible with\n          him. My host-sister Meghan was two years older than me. She was in\n          Paris for three months while I was there. I have never had a sister\n          before, so it was a great experience too. I am really grateful for\n          everything they have done for me!\n        </p>\n        <h3>\n          What classes did you take? Did you participate in any sport throughout\n          your stay?\n        </h3>\n        <p>\n          As for Miramonte, I usually spent the whole day there. I took\n          Pre-Calculus, CAD, 3D Art, Physiology, English, Sports Medicine and US\n          History. Sometimes it was pretty tough schedule to have every single\n          day. My favourite classes? The Physiology and US History were\n          definitely the classes where I have learned the most. Sports Med. was\n          a great fun. We were going on games of all kinds and were taking care\n          of Miramonte athletes. Right after school I usually went to the\n          Crosscountry practise. I have met many people there and I have not\n          gone out of my running shape at least.\n        </p>\n        <h3>What did you like the most? What places did you see?</h3>\n        <p>\n          The most? I loved so many things I did while I was there! The music\n          festivals like Outside Lands or Snowglobe were totally unforgettable.\n          The Bay Area was just awesome place. All the cities I have visited\n          were amazing... Las Vegas, Los Angeles, San Diego, Lake Tahoe,\n          Berkeley... I have just fallen in love with California. That's it.\n        </p>\n        <h3>Was there anything you disliked?</h3>\n        <p>\n          Sometimes I missed the freedom of hopping on a bus and going out\n          whenever I wanted. There were no buses so I had to ask someone to give\n          me a ride everytime and my host-mom did not want me to bike.\n          Fortunately there were four members of our family and each one had his\n          own car so it was not such a big deal.\n        </p>\n        <h3>\n          Any advice for the upcoming student? Would you recommend something?\n        </h3>\n        <p>\n          You just have to be yourself and open to everything, otherwise you\n          will miss a lot. Don't be shy. Try to do as many things you can\n          handle. Enjoy the chance you have!\n        </p>\n        <h3>Do you have any funny story you would like to share?</h3>\n        <p>\n          It was my third day in California, I was still little sleepy in the\n          evening (jet lag). However, I was partying hard at Outside Lands with\n          my sister and her friends. I did not have american SIM card in my\n          phone yet, so I had to stick to them well. But. There was fourty\n          tousand people partying with us and unfortunately Meghan met a guy who\n          was supposed to be her future boyfriend. Of course I got lost pretty\n          easily. I was super lucky to meet one of her friends at 2 am. His\n          phone was dead. At leats I had someone who knew where we were. We met\n          Meghan at a MUNI stop near to the Golden Gate Park. That could have\n          been a bummer!\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    </Container>\n  </Layout>\n)\n","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/marek-fencl-837d01f1f1bcc0e1e0e4b7c12367b36a.png\";"],"sourceRoot":""}
