The Physiology and US History were definitely the classes where I have learned the most. Sports Med. was a great fun. We were going on games of all kinds and were taking care of Miramonte athletes.

There was fourty tousand people partying with us and unfortunately Meghan met a guy who was supposed to be her future boyfriend. Of course I got lost pretty easily. I was super lucky to meet one of her friends at 2 am. His phone was dead. At leats I had someone who knew where we were. We met Meghan at a MUNI stop near to the Golden Gate Park. That could have been a bummer!"))))}}]);
