Any host brothers or sisters?</h3>\n        <p>\n          I stayed with the Thompsons. My hostmother's name was Maryett and my\n          hostfather was Bob. They had 3 children, all in collage - Mike, Allie\n          and Art (and his wife Amanda!). A big part of the family were also 2\n          amazing dogs. I could not ask for a more kind, carring, loving and\n          funny family!\n        </p>\n        <h3>\n          What classes did you take? Did you participate in any sport throughout\n          your stay?\n        </h3>\n        <p>\n          I took Cooking, Art, Photography, Sports medicine and English. All of\n          the classes were really fun and not that hard. My favourite was Sports\n          medicine. I played tennis after school every day. I was even on the\n          varsity team. The girls on the team were really nice and I loved to\n          spend my time with them while practising and on tournaments!\n        </p>\n        <h3>What did you like the most? What places did you see?</h3>\n        <p>\n          There and sooo many places I liked! My amazing host family took me to\n          LA (Disneyland), Arizona, Washington D.C., Texas and all around\n          California! Of course a have been to SF a couple times, it is my\n          favourite city...\n        </p>\n        <h3>Was there anything you disliked?</h3>\n        <p>\n          It is hard to find something that I disliked. The only thing that I\n          could think of was the long distance between everything so I had to\n          ask my host family for a ride every time I needed something. But my\n          host family was really nice so it was no problem.\n        </p>\n        <h3>\n          Any advice for the upcoming student? Would you recommend something?\n        </h3>\n        <p>\n          Be open, that is the main thing! Do sports, you will find many friends\n          there. And take easy and fun classes so you don't have to learn after\n          school that much :)\n        </p>\n        <h3>Do you have any funny story you would like to share?</h3>\n        <p>\n          There are so many funny stories that a can't share just one with you.\n          :)\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    </Container>\n  </Layout>\n)\n\nexport default MichaelaKopeckaPage\n"],"names":["MichaelaKopeckaPage","React","Layout","Helmet","Container","Link","className","to","src","ProfilePic","alt"],"sourceRoot":""}
