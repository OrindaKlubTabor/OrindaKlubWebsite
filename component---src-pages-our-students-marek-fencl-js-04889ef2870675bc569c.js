There was fourty tousand people partying with us and unfortunately Meghan met a guy who was supposed to be her future boyfriend. Of course I got lost pretty easily. I was super lucky to meet one of her friends at 2 am. His phone was dead. At leats I had someone who knew where we were. We met Meghan at a MUNI stop near to the Golden Gate Park.
