On top of that, I took the two mandatory subjects, English and American History, those two were easily the two hardest ones, because I was expected to match with my American classmates.

I got on the bus in Prague, and when I was getting of, I was standing in front of the luggage space, waiting for it to open, while suddenly, the bus started to move. My first thought was that it's just moving to a different place in the station, but then it started to accelerate and everything just clicked when it left the station. So yeah! That's the beginning of my journey to the US just with a backpack. PS: I never got the luggage back."))))}},Upzh:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"static/adam-kraus-7ff42b5ccaa96bfee0e25f6866c6a848.png"}}]);
