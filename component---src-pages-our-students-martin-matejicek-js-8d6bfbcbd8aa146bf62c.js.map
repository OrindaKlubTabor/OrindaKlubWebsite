Any host brothers or sisters?</h3>\n        <p>\n          Well it was wonderful Pinkerd family - Stacey and Christina (my\n          \"step-parents\") and Noelle with Alysha (my \"step-sisters\"). I cannot\n          forget other members as Foster and Monty (lovely, brave doggies) and\n          Misty, Jazzy and Sammy - three playful cats. Well I gotta say, I was\n          never bored :) This amazing family took a good care of me and I am\n          really greatful. They are all well harmonized and they accepted me as\n          I were their own.\n        </p>\n        <h3>\n          What classes did you take? Did you participate in any sport throughout\n          your stay?\n        </h3>\n        <p>\n          I took English, Government (with Mr. Hunter, Mr. Hunter was good, but\n          that class, eh, not the best choice I have made), Spanish, which was\n          fun, 3D Art, where I learned quite a lot, Drama (hillarious class,\n          found most of my friends right there) and Sports medicine (the\n          teacher, John, is the man!) As for sports - I played soccer, highly\n          recommend! Good group of people! All very supportive.\n        </p>\n        <h3>What did you like the most? What places did you see?</h3>\n        <p>\n          Well I loved the whole Cali, I saw a lot of stuff - Embarcadero was\n          cool, pier 39 as well. I have seen the Monterey bay and the famous\n          Aquarium in there. My family took me to Virginia, so that was\n          something else and cool.\n        </p>\n        <h3>\n          Any advice for the upcoming student? Would you recommend something?\n        </h3>\n        <p>\n          No fear, no panic, good mood, be friendly and you will do just fine!\n        </p>\n        <h3>Do you have any funny story you would like to share?</h3>\n        <p>\n          Well I am not sure if it is was funny but I loved it - At first I\n          should mention that I am a big fan of Forrest Gump. I was walking with\n          my family in SF and suddenly I noticed Tom Hanks sitting on a bench in\n          front of Bubba Gump Shrimp restaurant in his white suit with a box of\n          chocolate. I looked closer and it was not Tom Hanks but a dude who\n          looked exactly like him! So I sat next to him and we talked, I swear\n          he was like Forrest Gump! - after that we went to the Bubba Gump\n          Shrimp restaurant for a dinner. I was really excited.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    </Container>\n  </Layout>\n)\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
